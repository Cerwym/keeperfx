# OpenAL Soft Configuration
# This file helps OpenAL detect and use audio devices properly,
# especially when virtual audio devices (like SteelSeries Sonar) are present
#
# IMPORTANT: For this file to be read, either:
# 1. Copy it to: %APPDATA%\alsoft.ini
# 2. Or copy it to the same folder as keeperfx.exe
# 3. Or set environment variable: ALSOFT_CONF=path\to\alsoft.ini

[general]
# Disable logging by default (set to 3 or 4 to enable debugging)
# 0=none, 1=errors, 2=warnings, 3=info, 4=debug
#log-level = 3

# Output log to file for debugging (uncomment to enable)
#log-file = keeperfx_openal.log

# Drivers to try, in order of preference
# wasapi = Windows Audio Session API (modern, recommended for Windows 10/11)
# dsound = DirectSound (older, more compatible with virtual devices)
# winmm = Windows Multimedia (most compatible fallback)
drivers = wasapi,dsound,winmm

[wasapi]
# Allow WASAPI to access all devices (not just default)
allow-resampler = true

[dsound]
# DirectSound settings - often works better with virtual audio devices
# This can help if WASAPI has issues

[winmm]
# Windows Multimedia fallback

# Uncomment and set this to force a specific device by name
# To find device names, check keeperfx.log after enumeration
# Examples:
# default-device = "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)"
# default-device = "Headphones (USB Audio Device)"
# default-device = "SteelSeries Sonar - Gaming"

# If you want to bypass all virtual devices and use your physical hardware:
# default-device = "Speakers"

# Alternatively, you can exclude specific devices:
# excludes = "No Output","Null Output"
